This mod is an addon for the **[Botanical Machinery](https://github.com/ChaoticTrials/BotanicalMachinery?tab=readme-ov-file)**

#### The only thing that is strictly prohibited and subject to copyright is the textures of the graphical interfaces for each mechanism. The rest can be used in the public domain.
